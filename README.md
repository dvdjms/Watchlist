# Movie Watchlist

## Brief <br>

<p>Adapted from the Country Bucket List</p>
<p>The app should allow the  user to track directors and movies they want to watch and those they have watched.</p>
<p>The user should be able to create and edit directors.</p>
<p>Each director should have one or more movies to watch.</p>
<p>The user should be able to create and delete entries for movies.</p>
<p>The app should allow the user to mark movies as watched or still to see.</p><br>

### Possible Extension:
<p>Have separate pages for all movies and movies on the watchlist.</p>
<p>Have individual pages for directors and movies</p>
<p>Have user rating option.</p>
<p>The user can write reviews for movies.</p><br>
